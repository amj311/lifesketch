        <p>I was born on a cold winter morning on the 26 of December in the year One Thousand eight hundred and Seven of our Lord, and christened on February 21 of the following year. My parents named mee after my Father Robert who was a Butcher and Farmer in Gloucester. My Mother was Sarah Oakey</p>
        <p>As a boy i helped my Father in is Shoppe. He taught mee how to know which cows had the best meats and how to separate clean and prepare the cuts. We had a happy life though wee worked hard living among the fields and hamlets in the area known as Gloucestershire</p>

        <p>Our first years together have proved very trying indeed. Hannah and I settled in the hamlet of Apperly where I continued my father’s profession, raising livestock on our small farm and selling their meat to locals</p>
        <p>Amidst our economic troubles, both of my beloved parents fell ill and died within two years of each other. May they rest in peace</p>
        <p>I feel my heart conflicted again with the passing of my parents. The Methodist brethren disagree strongly with the Church of England over such matters as the proper way to care for our dead, and there were various disputes among my father’s family as to where he should be entombed</p>
        <p>I have of late been impressed with the preachings of Thomas Kington at Gadfield Elm, near Eldersfield. Hannah and I attend his sermons upon occasion, with the Benbow’s of Frome’s Hill, l and I feel there is truth in them. Mr. Kington professes that perhaps the original church of christ was entirely lost but will be restored in some future day. He encourages us to seek light and truth and believes that more will come</p>

        <p>There has been a great deal of unwelcome commotion regarding a strange preacher from the Americas. Hannah has been traveling with my sister Elizabeth near twenty miles to visit the Brenbow’s, who have already been baptized by this man. Even Mr Kington has been made a convert to this man’s new ideas. He must be a bold man indeed, to come through upsetting what was once a quiet place to live. I wish that Hannah would not listen to him or spend so much time away from the home</p>

        <p>The American Preacher, Woodruff, has taken to staying often at Elizabeth's home in Leigh.

            <p>A few days ago I arrived home and found Hannah sitting with the man Wilford Woodruff in my home. I ran into the room with a full mind to grab the man by is collar and toss him off of my land. But upon entering the house, a strange feeling overpowered me and I could not touch him. I left them there and sought refuge in the town pub</p>
            <p>I never backed down from a fight so that evening I organized a mob. The plot was to rotten egg the American preacher, then ride him out of town on a rail</p>
            <p>Once I had rounded up all the men I could find we marched back to my home. I told the men to wait for my signal. But once I was inside, I felt that odd power come over me again. Woodruff paused his sentence to greet me and Hannah introduced us. I can’t explain it, but all the anger was gone from my heart. I went back to the men outside and said there is something to this religion I have no more need of you. They left unhappily</p>
            <p>Brother Woodruff continued his meeting and I was finally convinced. I asked him to baptize me himself, and when he did I had been fully converted to Mormonism</p>
