    <div class="body">
        <p>I was born on a cold winter morning on the 26 of December in the year One Thousand eight hundred and Seven of our Lord, and christened on February 21 of the following year. My parents named mee after my Father Robert who was a Butcher and Farmer in Gloucester. My Mother was Sarah Oakey.</p>
        <p>As a boy i helped my Father in his Shoppe. He taught mee how to know which cows had the best meats and how to separate clean and prepare the cuts. We had a happy life though wee worked hard living among the fields and hamlets in the area known as Gloucestershire.</p>

        <p>I often go to play with the other boys in the streets. We've become fond of Pugilism - fighting honourably in a ring with one's fists. Except wee haven't got a ring. Just us boys geting dirty and scratched and scolded by our mums. I am the strongest of all! There is none that can fell mee!</p>
        <p>My sister Elizabeth who is younger than i often comes with mee to fight. She encourages mee yelling from the crowds.</p>

        <p>I've quickly become the greatest Pugilist in the shire! I no longer fight in the streets, but at the fairs, and for prize-money! Someday i hope to fight in the honorable rings of London town.</p>

        <p>Elizabeth has fallen into the afections of one of the Browett boys and was married to him recently. Daniel is a good man - a gentleman and a fellow Brother in our Methodist congregation. I've known him for some time.</p>
        <p>I myself have recently grown very fond of a young Woman by the name of Hannah Mariah Eagles. If her feelings are a reflection of my own i may ask for her hand!</p>

    <div class="body">
        <p>My Deare Hannah has accepted my hand in marriage!</p>
        <p>As both Hannah and i feel partial toward the Methodist movement wee petitiond a minister of that congregation to perform our rites early this spring, on the 18th of March. We passed a happy summer together until word began to spread of our marriage. Many of the older generation <note ft onclick="app.openNote('writing_style')">ternd</note> hostile toward us for English law only considers marriage to be legal if performed by the Church of England.</p>
        <p>To apease the law and our neighbours wee posted banns in the church and were married again by the Church of England on 28 of September in the Parish of St Mary de Lode. Elizabeth and Daniel acted as witnesses to the event.</p>
        <p>All this commotion has raised several questions in my mind. Why should there be Churches thus which war with each other over authority? Is there any one Church that can claim the proper authority to perform a marriage?</p>
